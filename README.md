# Startpage

A very basic browser startpage I will probably never actually use! There are still some things I would like to add/adjust, though. I worked on this to:

* Learn more about css grids
* Use an API... for the first time
* Play around with colors

### weather.js

This is currently set to require a config.js that will accept an [openweathermap.org](https://www.openweathermap.org) key as `MY_API_TOKEN` and requisite latitude and longitude as `LAT` and `LONG`, respectively. I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but it's my first go.

### Resources

Thanks to:

* Quentin Curri's [Pixel Startpage](https://github.com/QuentinCurri/pixel-startpage), which helped me understand how to setup the weather API
* [This article](https://bithacker.dev/fetch-weather-openweathermap-api-javascript) and the [bfg tool](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/), for the same reason
* [This article](https://dev.to/ptprashanttripathi/how-to-hide-api-key-in-github-repo-2ik9), when it hit me I probably didn't want my latitude and longitude and API key sitting in weather.js
